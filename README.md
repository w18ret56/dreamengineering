# Dream Engineering
***This project is based  and inspired by article [Dream engineering: Simulating worlds through sensory stimulation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810020300325) and the [Dormio Project](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/sleep-creativity/overview/)***

## What is dream engineering?
Dream engineering is a process of influencing the dreams by using external stimuli (sound, visual, temperature, somatosensation (touch & pressure) and olifactory (smell)) 

## Is it Lucid Dreaming?
No, but DE could be useful in causing lucid dreams

## It sound great! Are there any devices or applications based on this?
See [PROJECTS](PROJECTS.md)
